# Font-End-Restaurant-Passport

## Description

Our product solves this problem by suggesting restaurants nearby for users. This takes off the unnecessary stress of trying to figure out where to eat. It also solves their issue of always eating at the same place, because we are giving them new suggestions that they may not have been too. Lastly, they are able to track their visual progress for themselves or to show their friends, by using our passport ability. The passport ability gives them the ease of visually seeing where they have been by “punching off” a restaurant once they go to it.<br />

At RestaurantPassport we aim to give our users a stress-free eating experience by easily finding somewhere to satisfy their stomachs.
